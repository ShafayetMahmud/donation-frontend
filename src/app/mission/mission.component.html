        Our journey to worship Allah is eternal, in this world and in Jannah. Mankind, while on earth, needs to live their lives
        and establish themselves as the rightful successors of Adam to Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam). 
        The individuals involved in organizing and those benefiting from the institute will work with the sole mission of pleasing Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala,
        following Al-Qur'an and the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam).

      The institute will sustain itself through its own income sources and Zakah from its benefactors,
      using these resources to provide shelter and education for the needy and orphaned children.
      Since Zakah will be utilized, expenditures will be strictly within the eight categories where Zakah is permissible.

      Through this comprehensive education, students will grow into individuals who understand how to please Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala,
      contribute to future generations, and become leaders in society. In Sha Allah, students will be equipped to pursue higher education
      at any esteemed institution (BUET, RUET, DU, Medical Colleges, Al-Azhar University, Al-Medina University, etc.) or start a business/professional life.
