          Our journey to worship Allah is eternal, in this world and in Jannah. Mankind, while on earth, needs to live

          Sallam). The individuals involved in organizing and those benefiting from the institute will work with the sole
          mission of pleasing Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, following Al-Qur'an and the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet
          Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam).
